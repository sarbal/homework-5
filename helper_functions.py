def map_read_to_gene(read: str, ref_seq: str, genes: GeneDict) -> Tuple[str, float]:
    """
    Align a DNA sequence (read) against a reference sequence, and map it to the best matching gene.

    This function takes a DNA sequence, aligns it to a given reference sequence,
    and determines the best matching gene from a provided gene dictionary.
    It uses local alignment and computes the Hamming distance to evaluate the similarity of the read to gene sequences.
    The function returns the name of the best matching gene and the similarity score.
    You can use 'pairwise2.align.localxs(ref_seq, read, -1, -1)' to perform local alignment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    read: str
        The DNA sequence to be aligned. This sequence should not include the cell barcode or the oligo-dT primer. It represents the mRNA fragment obtained from sequencing.
    ref_seq: str
        The complete reference sequence (e.g., a viral genome) against which the read will be aligned. This sequence acts as a basis for comparison.
    genes: GeneDict
        A dictionary where keys are gene names and values are objects or tuples containing gene start and end positions in the reference sequence. This dictionary is used to identify specific genes within the reference sequence.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[str, float]
        - gene: str
            The name of the gene to which the read maps best. If the read aligns best to a non-gene region, return `None`.
        - similarity: float
            The similarity score between the read and the best matching gene sequence, calculated as the Hamming distance. This is a measure of how closely the read matches a gene, with higher values indicating better matches.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function performs local alignment of the read against the reference sequence and each gene segment.
    - If the read aligns better to a region outside of any gene, the function should return `None` for the gene name.
    - The function should handle cases where no alignment is found.

        `genes`. The dataframe columns should be to a list of strings
        corrsponding to genes and the dataframe index should be a list of
        strings corresponding to cell barcodes. Each cell in the matrix should
        indicate the number of times a read mapped to a gene in that particular
